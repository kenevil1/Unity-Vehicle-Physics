# Unity-Vehicle-Physics
I've made this project in order to show running examples of Unity's in built physics engine simulating vehicle physics.



As the GIF below shows I have demonstrated physical wheels carrying a basic chasis over some obstacles in its path. The clip also shows the wheel's suspension capabilities.

I have also made a basic car controller which uses the wheels to steer and provide torque.
